            "Since our inception, we have believed that building and maintaining a unique and exciting workplace is a continuously evolving process. We do not believe in resting on our laurels when it comes to creating a culture which energises every employee every day at the workplace! You will discover while reading through this document that this special environment at Company1_IT has been brewed with purpose. It has risen out of committed Leadership, effective design, processes, empathy & a highly motivated workforce.\n",
            "Our principles & beliefs are stronger than ever this year. Like so many other businesses, we have seen challenges and change, but we believe the following themes to be our guiding lights. We believe that it is from these five distinctive behaviours below that our exclusive workplace has been born. These behaviours have led to our growth, immunity to challenges and the superlative brand that we are ever building with customers & employees alike.\n",

            "Our Values are strong, alive and in play at Company1_IT. These distinctive behaviours above are in sync with our values and have, in fact, been derived from them. Our values are Company1_IT’s constitution. All our leaders have them internalised. They live and disseminate these values across the organisation through action & speech every day. Our Values are:\n",

            "We Care\n",
            "Execution excellence\n",
            "Entrepreneurial spirit\n",
            "As you can see, our distinctive behaviours are connected deeply to our values. Without intent & distinctive behaviours, values are meaningless. Moving forward, we will try and express how our values and distinctive behaviours culminate into meaningful & effective systems. We believe that true success in attaining both Business & People delight comes from effective execution. We have a simple formula to express this.\n",
            "{Internalized Values Distinctive behaviour Effective Systems = Business Success People Happiness.}\n",
            "Let’s look at each distinctive behaviour in more detail. This deeper dive will show how values, distinctive behaviors & execution systems are connected at Company1_IT. It is this culture-creating dynamic which has given us the equity we possess today from both our customers and our people.\n",
            "Obsession with People & Happiness (Customers & Employees alike!)\n",
            "Our mission to engineer a unique experience starts prior to Day 0 for a Any employee, even before the person walks into the workplace. We would like to showcase our induction & assimilation programme, Silk Road, below. The intent of the document is not only to highlight the processes but additionally bring out the enthusiasm and passion of Any employees (our employees) behind each of these processes and initiatives. We believe that there lies distinctiveness. This mindset is created through each member of the leadership displaying their commitment to this programme by participating and supporting it. Additionally, people from all functions, geographies and departments are involved in it and ensure that welcome experiences are special for the newbie. Naturally, fun moments become a part of the organisation’s lore. Engagement from all in welcoming new hires creates bonhomie from Day 1 and gives a message that the complete organisation cares when a new hire joins.\n",
            "Hence Silk Road, as the name suggests, utilises various communication media through which new joiners get a deeper introduction to Company1_IT to deliver a seamless onboarding experience. The idea is to engage with joiners even before they come on board with us and develop their understanding and preparedness on day 1 in the organisation.\n",
            "A customized practice-specific new joiner assimilation is followed with the objective of providing concise and updated information about the corporate and practice overview, organisation/ practice structure, and our values/culture. This decentralisation makes the assimilation process quicker and easily administrable, given the high number of new hires every month. It is important to note that our programme has important touch points such as building a thorough understanding of the business, knowing about career options at Company1_IT & feeling the culture. We ensure that our people have a smooth touchdown at the workplace, know what they are getting into and feel welcomed with open arms.\n",
            "We have also introduced an onboarding excellence program in 2022 aiming to help Any employees (our people) settle down in their first 30 days in the organisation with seamless assimilation. This involves an array of activities, including an introduction to the Buddy, a customised welcome note from the manager introducing the new joiner to the team, enabling systematic access to knowledge repositories, and connecting with the leadership team members to help the new joiner understand the role and the business of the customers we are supporting. Through these measures, the overall onboarding favourability index, as captured in the 30-day survey, has gone up to 90% in 2022.\n",
            "Our 60-day pulse survey indicated that:\n",
            "93% of respondents intend to stay at Company1_IT for the foreseeable future,\n",
            "91% of respondents are clear on their career path at Company1_IT,\n",
            "88% of respondents reported healthy team dynamics and collaboration, and\n",
            "94% of respondents are willing to refer Company1_IT to their friends.\n",
            "Our Buddy program has proven to be extremely effective. New joiners get acquainted on a fast track with our work culture- unspoken norms, traditions, etc., as well as a granular understanding of their new roles and responsibilities. They feel welcomed and cared for and get settled quickly as buddies are there to resolve their queries related to internal tools, technology, and other softer issues within the organisation. \n",
            "A workshop is conducted for those identified to play the role of a buddy from time to time (including refreshers). They are provided with a ready reference document, enabling them to play their role effectively. We believe that the skills of the ‘buddy’ have a direct correlation to the success of this programme and the newcomer’s experience. The effectiveness of this initiative is measured through a feedback survey taken from both the new joiner and the buddies on the 30th Day from joining a cultural survey as well on the 60th day, as to how well the new Any employee understands the DNA of the Company and values.\n",
            "Once our people have been settled in and flow seamlessly into day-to-day work, we focus on making each day exciting. A large part of this experience is owned by leaders & people managers across all levels, from the frontline manager to the CXO. As you will later see in the sections talking about growing leaders, we stress all our Leaders being exceptional people managers as well. We believe that Customer Success (a Core Value) can only truly materialise if our people give their best. It is the Leader’s responsibility (irrespective of level) to deliver high standards of engagement to their respective teams.\n",
            "Here are our core engagement processes which are run both in letter & spirit by our leaders. Here again, we would stress the ‘spirit’ with which these programmes are run. It is a must that they are enthusiastic, fun, exciting & involving in every single member of the team.\n",
            "Appreciation week.\n",
            " \n",
            "It is part of our culture to empower people, and as we continue our growth as an organisation, it becomes imperative to recognise and praise the achievements of our Any employees.  As we went closer to the year’s end, we expressed our gratitude to our colleagues, who helped us deliver outstanding outcomes and succeed in our endeavours in December 2022. \n",
            " \n",
            "Our leaders encouraged everyone to return to our key learning from our formative years of saying “Thank you”. While appreciation and recognition are often used interchangeably, it is important to note that there is a slight difference between them. Recognition usually needs a token to express it – like a reward or a prize, whereas appreciation is more like a culture - where saying thank you often, putting a team's needs over your own, or valuing individuals for their effort as much as for their success - all count as appreciation. Appreciation week was all about honouring our valued colleagues, co-workers, and leaders through value badges available on the Thanks portal and our Rewards & Recognition portal. \n",
            "Around 3700 appreciation badges were exchanged in 5 days as a part of the appreciation week initiative!\n",

As part of the Company1_IT culture workshop, we talk about Company1_IT values and competencies to all existing Any employees, new joiners and campus freshers. We have also identified role models for each of these values and competencies. \n",
            " \n",
            "The key objectives of these workshops are:\n",

            "1) Propagate the Company1_IT story, including what Company1_IT does and how Company1_IT does it differently,\n",

            "3) Recognize the importance of always being Company1_IT to the organisation, employees, internal & external customers and other key constituent audiences,\n",
            "4) Internalize their role in Being Company1_IT and living the new values and culture,\n",
            "5) Inform and inspire all employees to live up to the promises of Being Company1_IT.\n",
            " \n",
            "These individual sessions aim to build a strong culture around company values and to inculcate these values in all Any employees so that it ultimately becomes the DNA of the organisation. We have monthly sessions that are aimed to explain the Company1_IT context for each of the company values so that the Any employees can demonstrate in their client projects and then share their success stories.\n",
            " \n",
            "Along the same lines, we have created an award by the name of Value champion to recognise those Any employees who consistently exhibit the behaviours associated with our values. The Value champion award winners are recognised and celebrated on the floor so that every Any employee can look up to them as role models. The managers of the respective winners then do a ‘story-telling' session highlighting the behaviours of the individual which he/she exhibited, which resulted in them getting the award. This has led to building a culture and awareness across the organisation that everything in Company1_IT revolves around our four values which implies that it is vital for an individual as well as for the teams to exhibit these values in their day-to-day activities.\n",

            " \n",
            "In the year 2022, we’ve had more than 2400 Any employees in India rewarded by their managers using the Thanks portal. Including the managers, about 60% of Any employees participated in the recognition process in the year using the Thanks portal to fuel the culture of rewards and recognition. Similarly, we also recognise the contributions of our team members through our 3, 5, 10 and 15th Anniversary awards.\n",
            " \n",
            "Additionally, we also take the moment to share our wishes with our team members who have witnessed a major event of joy in their personal lives- be it marriage or welcoming their small bundle of joy through our “Wedding” and “Happy Motherhood” gift policies.\n",
            " \n",
            "Whenever a new business deal is struck, or a business logo is won, or a project milestone is achieved, the success is celebrated to spread joy! We believe that every success for us as an organisation must be shared with everyone on the work floor. Celebrating success together creates a sense of unity and recognition. Our engagement teams weave together an unforgettable celebratory experience in line with our success. These are events of joy and achievement that the entire organisation shares together.\n",

            "Another core element to the superlative experience that we curate is Work-Life Balance and Wellness. Here again, genuine understanding and respect for the above is the key ingredient to success. Our Leaders truly believe in the regenerative potential of work-life balance and wellness. At Company1_IT, it is not a ‘buzzword’ for the management to be dropped at meetings!\n",
            "As we moved into post COVID era in 2022, most of the organisations in the IT industry started asking employees to return to work. For us, it is always the health and safety of our employees first. Hence, despite the industry trends, we decided not to force this upon people. We understood how the pandemic had impacted and scarred people. As the situation started getting better, we wanted people to be back at the workplace. We wanted activity and buzz back again. However, we wanted to do so in a systematic manner giving significant flexibility, time and space to the employees to plan their return to work. \n",
            " \n",
            " \n",
            "Hence, though all our sites were made operational and we invited and didn’t force employees to work from the office. We continue with our policy of no fixed work timings or a mandatory number of hours to be logged in so that employees have the flexibility to attend to their personal needs while balancing the work. There is continuous encouragement and support from leaders to help team members have an adequate work-life balance. We do realise that the nature of the workplace itself is changing and have a genuine intent to be flexible and partner with our people in these times of change.\n",
            "We have a generous Health insurance plan in place that provides relief to employees in their hour of need for any medical exigency, especially as the last year has been tough and rough in the wake of COVID-19. This plan covers employees, their spouses and dependent children (ESC) under the company’s floater health insurance scheme with INR 5,00,000/- base coverage. The premium is paid by Company1_IT and is over and above the employee’s CTC. Additionally, if an employee wishes, s/he can also go for a Health Insurance Top-up of up to 10 lakhs and can enhance the ESC cover up to 15 lakhs by paying an optional premium in excess of the base coverage. Company1_IT also provides a platform for employees to gift an insurance plan to their parents/parents-in-law with INR 3,00,000/- of annual coverage by paying an optional premium. Additionally, the Top cover option is available for parents up to 5 lakhs. We also cover all our employees under a Life Insurance policy, the coverage being up to three times their total Gross Salary per annum. If they are diagnosed with a terminal illness, 50% of the sum insured is paid out in advance.\n",
            " We intend to provide the best medical support to our employees by enhancing the benefits in our existing policy each year. This year based on the feedback received by employees, we have added to our existing health insurance two additional benefits viz- Cataract (upgraded the coverage) and Fracture /injuries/dislocation of bone/joints Coverage (OPD coverage provided).\n",
            "People have a say!\n",
            "Our philosophy is to be ‘hell-bent’ on transparency & clarity. We want our people to be stakeholders in everything that we do. Whether it is a business strategy, workplace dynamics or even their own facilities and benefits, we involve our people in the information flow and decision-making. \n",
            "Fine-Tuned Employee Benefits\n",
            "Employee benefits are critical for people to possess a hygienic level of happiness. Hence, we feel these benefits must be defined based on their feedback! In 2022, we refined some of our benefits to make them impactful and easily accessible for our employees. Here are some of our policies which we fine-tuned in consultation with our people via workshops.\n",
            "COVID taught us that emergencies of any nature- physical, psychological, or financial could arise uninvited at any point in time in our lives. While our medical insurance benefit equips our employees to deal with medical emergencies financially, at times, the expenses cannot be completely covered by them. There are other situations where employees may need additional financial support to cater to their sudden personal needs. Hence, we introduced the Salary Advance policy through which employees can take a salary advance to support their immediate financial requirements.\n",
            "We have also revitalised our Car lease policy based on employee feedback by engaging a new partner to make the benefit more impactful and easily accessible for the employees.\n",
            "Employee feedback is critical for us, and we are always in motion to look at more ways to improve our policies using their feedback, thereby enabling employee participation in the policy/benefit formulation process. We currently use both internal and external surveys to gather feedback from our employees. Please refer to the metrics section at the end of this question. Quarterly All hands meet (Townhall): Our quarterly ‘all hands meet’ events continue to be a strong platform for open conversations. This is not a mere top-down communication meeting, but we take pains to ensure that the agenda for every quarterly meeting is as co-created as possible. To this end, we ensure that the preparation begins at least one month in advance, wherein we seek employee feedback (through a survey) on what they would like to be covered in specific first. Depending upon the employee feedback and questions thus received, the agenda is fine-tuned three (3) days before the town hall and shared with everyone. Due updates on the Organisation/ business, Solution updates, Opportunities/ Pipeline updates on upcoming projects, Team/ People spotlight, and Project spotlight are, of course, shared to keep the employees well-informed. We make our employees understand the challenges/risks of the organisation by giving them more business and industry-level information, which helps the employees deliver what is needed for the growth of the organisation. Employee questions are responded to, and if any remain unanswered, a transcript of all replies is promptly made available to all electronically.\n",
            "Monthly ‘Ask me anything’ meetings: These meetings are also another more focused tool for open and honest conversations. On a monthly basis, our senior management leaders interact with smaller groups of Any employees in a completely informal setup(‘Ask me anything’),encouraging an open and hierarchy-less dialogue and culture. This is a testament to our openness, where there is no room for hierarchies or red tape. It has created an atmosphere where our colleagues come together to discuss the common success goals we are trying to achieve as a company. Our team managers also connect with their direct reports/ teams on a Weekly/Monthly,/Quarterly basis and share all new initiatives happening in the company and also provide them feedback on their performance to enhance their performance level. One-on-One connects are done with the employees by the manager and the business HR. Skip-level meetings are usually done on a quarterly basis across practices and functions. It provides a platform for employees to directly connect with their level 2 or level 3 managers to understand if there is any gap between the leaders and the front-line employees. The queries that their immediate managers couldn’t address are usually addressed here. If there are any concerns or team conflicts which need senior leaders’ intervention, the same are discussed in skip-level meetings and taken forward with appropriate action plans. \n",
            "We understand that some of the employees may not open up in team meetings; hence we follow an open-door policy which allows any employee from any level to connect with any leader in the business without any hesitation or fear. These connects help the leaders to build rapport with our employees in a better way and help them at the time of retention as well.\n",

It is based on role architecture and is supported by a competency and skill framework; the program aims to create a structured and uniform approach towards career management at Company1_IT and empower every Any employee to become the custodian of their career development in the organisation. The program enables managers with a consistent and valuable tool to help the team members artfully navigate career growth conversations with their people.

We think that if we are not plugged into the environment, we cannot truly understand our own pulse and thus will not be able to evolve. Also, Social Platforms are ideal for us to showcase life at Company1_IT. So we can both ‘tell stories’ and ‘listen to employees’ on these platforms. We have appointed social evangelists within the organisation who use forums and communications to encourage our people to be social. The information coming in from social channels is also statistically valid, as we have over 355K people on our network. Hence be it Linkedin, Glassdoor or Facebook, we have a strong presence on all of these platforms. Our ratings on these platforms are very positive, and if we take an example from Glassdoor, our ratings/scores have seen positive trends year after year.\n",
            "We have also seen massive levels of participation from our people on social platforms. This indicates a heightened level of awareness and pride within our people. Any employees, acting as influencers, had a tremendous impact on our social channels. By creating more avenues for Any employees to share glimpses of ‘Life at Company1_IT’, the engagement rate has increased by 200% across all social channels over the last two years. We would also like to mention that nearly 30% of our content contribution on social media is led by Any employees.\n",
            "Storytelling and lore are also an integral part of our culture at Company1_IT. We capture our stories from work life, achievers, pioneers, kindness & camaraderie through the various initiatives below. These stories buzz our corridors, cafeterias, and meeting rooms.

            "Goal Setting: 100% \n",
            "Average learning hours: spent by each employee in the organisation is about 80 Hours/per year.\n",
            "Overall global mobility: our numbers picked up significantly in Q3, and the trend is ongoing from the end of Q2, with about 70 people moving globally.\n",
            "Employer Brand on Social Platforms: Glassdoor ratings for Company1_IT have gone from 3.8 to 4.0 on a scale of 5. Also, on Glassdoor, our CEO ratings have gone up from 86% to 91 %. \n",

            "Do spare a second to look at the words in our values highlighted in red. These would be our keywords to address this particular question. Our approach to maximising people’s potential would be supported by these five bastions. For example, there can be no Customer Success if we do not enable our people to succeed. If we don’t care for people, we cannot expect them to be committed. Again if we do not provide capability building & learning, we will eventually not reach desired excellence benchmarks. We aim to perform beyond the set excellence benchmarks. Lastly is the perspective of building a spirit within the hearts and minds of our employees. This spirit makes our people special. They do not consider working for Company1_IT to be ‘just another job’. They have a feeling of ownership and belonging to Company1_IT, which gives us an edge when it comes to how much every individual at Company1_IT contributed to the business. The initiatives and processes below will give you an understanding of how this architecture works at Company1_IT.\n",
            "Enabling Success.\n",
            "Closely linked to our values, enabling people to succeed is mission-critical at Company1_IT. We drive this via proven & instituted mechanisms. Our people get assurance that ‘we’ve their back’ right from the word GO. Our onboarding is automated, with a built-in audio-based Induction module, essentially covering policies, benefits, and processes, thereby ensuring information consistency, and eliminating any risk of missing critical communication. This leaves the onboarding team with more time to engage newcomers deeply. There are more conversations, regular calls and diligent guidance and advice. An important aspect here is that our Leadership team is very involved in inducting talent. Our CXOs devote several hours a week to talking to and interacting with incoming Any employees. This ensures enablement even before these people set foot in the organisation. \n",
            "We would also like to stress the point that we customise onboarding for every individual. We reckon that adapting to a new organisational culture while being held accountable for producing immediate results can be overwhelming for a new colleague. A solid integration plan thus assumes a critical significance for setting up a new colleague for success. An individualized onboarding plan is prepared to help accelerate their integration into Company1_IT and ensure a smooth transition into their new role. During this phase, HR Business partners play a key role in ensuring a smooth understanding of the company, culture, people, and processes, clarifying expectations and fostering key relationships with their team, business leaders, other functional leaders, etc., apart from ensuring all administrative items are addressed (e.g., laptop, mobile, tools access, distribution lists, etc.). These may be hygiene, but we feel execution should be seamless here. As if you don’t get this right, then it could generate a negative experience in the minds of new joiners. \n",
            " \n",
            "For other employees in organisation at various stages of their careers, we have a multitude of enabling practices. Here are the flagship programmes we want to showcase:\n",
            "We have deployed several external IT systems, tools, and apps to effectively manage day-to-day employee transactions in a secure and efficient manner. For example, we use Fusion HRIS, which provides Employee/ Manager Self Services and hosts our employee data, and Net Suite, which we use for P&L, Project Allocation, Travel, Purchase, and other transactions. On top of it, we have an in-house developed employee app, ‘On the go (OTG),’ which connects all of these external systems and provides a delightful front-end-user experience to our employees for their day-to-day transactions such as application of leave/external duty/ work from home, filling timesheets and expenses, etc. This app is also used for capturing Performance Dialogues and is a gateway for Company news, new announcements, key Contacts, and employee communication. This additionally serves as an IT & HR query management tool, using which our colleagues can raise queries, view history, review status, and provide feedback through a conversational UI.\n",
            "We have deployed ‘Salesforce’ for forecasting, and pipeline management, primarily used by Customer Success, Leadership, and Delivery Heads. CODEX (Customer Oriented Delivery Experience) is an internal system that is used for Project setup, Execution, Governance, Project Health, and Customer Satisfaction. FUEL provides the integrated fulfilment view for both internal and external hires. Internal employees can get to see all open positions and apply through IJP. We extensively use Microsoft cloud-based workplace collaboration tools such as SharePoint, MS Teams, O365, and OneDrive. While MS Teams is used to chat, set up internal meetings, and collaborate across Company1_IT, Zoom is used for external meetings. SharePoint connects our employees to various systems like Payroll, OnTheGo, Fusion, FUEL, Salesforce, and Helpdesk.\n",
            " \n",
            "We Care (& respect your efforts).\n",
            "To us, saying ‘we care’ aren’t just words but a living ethos. We have worked on building systems that offer our people an ecosystem where they can deliver their best. These systems focus on flexibility, comfort, self-esteem, motivation & empowerment. In this section, we want to highlight how Company1_IT touches the heart of every single person working with us. Hence in the context of Question 2, which is about maximising potential, empathy plays a role. One of the reasons our people feel cared for comes from empathy at Company1_IT. \n",
            "Here we’d like to tell the story of how our levels of care were heightened after experiencing the pandemic and post-pandemic tumult. What the organisation could clearly view was how the management, leadership and Human Resources rallied behind them in these times of strife. There is no greater motivator than kindness and empathy. There is no greater binder of people than empathy. Here are some of the initiatives:\n",
            "\n",
            "Required medical expenses of employees have been reimbursed over and above their limits.\n",
            "We have stretched medical & other benefits to support relatives and friends of theirs. We realised this mattered to them. \n",
            "We did not enforce any type of binding regulations regarding workplace and timings. We continue to do this to this very day. Having understood that the world and the nature of work have evolved and are in a state of flux after the pandemic.\n",
            "Leaders have travelled to the hometowns of employees and met Any employeesto offer reassurance and motivation.\n",
            "Our Bringing smiles CSR initiative has deeply impacted the psyche of so many of our employees. This has extended our empathy to the world at large. Our people have been involved in various forms of social service. Employees have felt their lives to be much more meaningful being a part of this incredible initiative. We have expanded on this in detail in Question 6.\n",
            " \n",
            " \n",
            "Execution Excellence (Capability & Learning).\n",
            "Excellence & Customer delight are strongly connected to the capability of our people. We believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that our people are equipped to deliver. Also, we believe that it is essential to have a systems approach to learning. Our Learning Team has designed several focused systems cutting across all levels and demographics. Here again, we would like to stress a Learning Culture that we have built, stemming from the involvement and sponsorship of leaders, the enthusiasm of employees to learn and grow and finally, the mission of grooming and developing world-class talent that we can offer to our customers, thus ensuring their success & delight. Here are some of our signature programmes.\n",
            "Professional Development Programmes.\n",
            "We have made a significant investment and commitment to professional skills development for all our people. The budget kept aside towards learning & development is in excess of INR 580 Lacs (Rupees 58 million),\n",
            "This commitment can be best evidenced through the fact that this year to date, we have covered 3400 unique learners, involving 1,84,000 learning hours, through multiple technical, soft-skills, leadership and domain courses along with several self-paced programs hosted by Learning Platforms like Udemy.\n",
            "1350 Any employees have added a professional certification to their profile this year across all categories and certifying bodies (total new certifications added this year 2180) under our Grab the Cap initiative, which enables any Any employee to register himself/herself for any certification by completing self-paced learning (on Udemy), take practice exams, and get the expenses reimbursed.  \n",
            "Upskilling & Capability.\n",
            "We have several focused interventions around Upskilling and capability building. The significant ones are LEAP Ahead Program for Budding Architects, Snowflake Capability Building Program, Terraform Capability Building Program, Architect Development Program for Data Engineers in tracks (AWS and Azure), Scrum Dojo and many more Upskilling Programs.\n",
            "Some of these programs, for instance, LEAP Ahead Program for budding Architects, is a multi-phase rigorous program, running through a few months, aimed at future capability building. It comprises five weeks of self-paced learning, four weeks of expert-led training, eight weeks of shadowing under mentors and finally,a white paper presentation and publishing.\n",
            "Company1_IT Academy.\n",
            "We believe that our people are our greatest differentiators and enablers. We, therefore, ensure to help Any employees on their learning journeys and provide them with adequate learning opportunities to pivot and adopt new skills. We deliver an ecosystem of access-from-anywhere digital learning platforms with best-in-class partnerships under Company1_IT Academy. We follow a talent segment-specific tailored approach. We enable Any employees to engineer their career through the choice of schools, each addressing the unique needs of a specific segment, along with a targeted approach and interventions. Engineering School is our school to upskill our tech workforce on next-gen digital technologies. Customer Success School is our school to build next-gen Customer Success role holders with the Company1_IT DNA, aimed at Account Managers and Customer Success Role Holders. Sector School, open to all roles, is our school to build domain expertise for Champion and Attack accounts. Leadership School is our school to mentor and create a strong pipeline for Resilient and Future Ready leaders. Graduate School is our school that provides our fresh engineering graduates with a platform to learn, practice and be ready for a successful career. And finally, Project and Program Transformation school is the school that allows Any employees to get assimilated into Company1_IT Ways of Working and ensure constant and consistent delivery to our customers.\n",
            "Growing Leaders.\n",
            "Through our Account Management School program, 20-30 Hi-potential colleagues are identified every year to go through a 6-month rigorous development journey involving stretch assignments, learning on the go, self-paced and classroom learning inputs, working on projects and working with a mentor, etc. Approximately 60% of the participants are usually able to make it to the final graduation due to the program rigour (which is a part of the design.) These graduates are given preference for progression into a new Account Manager role over new hires from the market. Hence it is clear that our priority lies in grooming leadership from within the organisation.\n",
            " \n",
            "Prepping Potential for Fresh Talent.\n",
            "It would not be wrong if we say that our engagement efforts start six (6) months prior to the actual joining for our new fresher hires (so far, we on boarded approximately 300Any employeesthis year), hired through various Universities/off-campus channels. As one of the industry-best practices, we cover all freshers through 8 to 10 weeks of the ‘Learn before Joining Company1_IT (LBJ)’ program consisting of 100 learning hours while they are still completing their course at the University. This gives them a first-hand glimpse of our enabling culture and deepens the bond between new hires and Any employees. LBJ also provide foundational knowledge on some of the technologies Company1_IT uses, which in turn accelerates their learning curve once they join. \n",
            "For adjacent hires (those with 2 years of experience and having adjacent skills, and we on-boarded 125 new hires in the year), we upskill them through brushing up on their core tech skills, 5 weeks of the immersive training program, and a1-week Capstone project to integrate all learnings from the program. \n",
            "Entrepreneurial Spirit\n",
            "We feel that there is a powerful connection between the psyche and the ability to be the best at what you do. It is not all about knowledge, capability and being equipped. Morale is a powerful driver, and a feeling of ownership is what gives us the edge. Hence along with the more material aspects of maximising potential, this particular concept of ‘Spirit’ is also crucial. There are several processes, as you will see below, that are being used at Company1_IT to infuse this ‘Spirit’ into our people. Some of our signature initiatives which continue to build this are:\n",
            "Bringing the change you want to see.\n",
            "A global millennial group of 20 Any employees across practices is formed periodically. This group has been connecting with the CEO monthly and providing inputs on what’s working well and what’s not on the ground. All these interactions were themed around transparency, role effectiveness, etc. This process involves even the most ‘fresh’ talent indecision-making. This is a powerful inductor of ownership and morale. We get regular feedback from employees mentioning that this initiative invokes strong feelings of ownership.\n",
            "Leveraging Inner Strengths.\n",
            " \n",
            "Developing our inner strengths is also key to us growing our potential. We believe and understand that there is considerable coaching and training capacity in every organisation. One just has to provide the right avenues for these people to show themselves and contribute to developing others. Not only does it provide stimulation & knowledge to the coaches and the learners but it also strengthens camaraderie and collaboration. “Do you see a trainer in yourself?” This is a shout-out to our fellow colleagues and project practitioners to raise their hands and teach/ impart their knowledge to fellow Any employees as a mentor and groom the young talent pool. In the last quarter alone, ten senior project managers raised their hand to make a difference- to themselves as they realise their true potential and to the Organization.\n",
            " \n",
            "Having Fun on the go!\n",
            "People from across the organisation voluntarily come together to organise fun events & celebrations. Events range across the company and account wins, various festivals or important events, employees’ birthdays, day trips, and team building activities et al. We live by the simple motto, \"Happy employees keep clients happy\". The events have helped the team bond and create a sense of togetherness. Examples of activities driven by the people & the HR team in the last few months are Game Night Virtual Team Building, Holiday Dinner Parties, Photo Contests, Pumpkin Carving Contests, Talk Show Series with Leadership, Ice Cream Socials, and Company1_IT Kids.\n",
            "Hiring Right!\n",
            "Our search for people who want to belong to an organisation like ours is always on. Looking for the right talent that would thrive in a culture like ours is a passion for us. Our search & selection process is not only about hiring ‘skills’ but is about hiring a ‘persona’. Here are some our aspects of our hiring philosophy that set us apart.\n",
            "Inclusive and evidence-based hiring.\n",
            "We continue to offer equal opportunity employment without any discrimination based on caste, religion, colour, race, ethnicity, gender identity and/or expression, sexual orientation or physical disabilities. Accordingly, all our business leaders and hiring managers are sensitized to inclusive hiring and encouraged to hire diverse talent across segments. Hiring the right candidate infuses the right technology disruptions in a fast-paced, dynamic and uber-cool place such as Company1_IT. With this in mind, we ensure each of our interviewer ‘shares that passion while evaluating a candidate. Evidence-based selection process enables us to bring culturally fit candidates who prosper in our environment. We have defined a set of situation-based questions for each of our behavioural competencies coupled with a psychometric assessment.\n",
            "We have already built a diverse workforce of 29%women representation by 2022, and we expect it to grow by 30%. We are going the extra mile not just to fill positions but have researched the industry to identify which jobs have more female candidates, in which jobs women are more successful and also what kind of training we can provide to fill the skill gap. It helps the Talent Acquisition team to have a targeted search and concentrate on being talent advisors to women. We continue to ensure that we remove biases throughout the Hiring process through workshops and interviewer training programs.\n",

            "Values\n",
            "What are your organization’s values or guiding principles? Please share three (3) specific examples of how you have put them into practice.\n",
            "Description : \n",
            "“Our Values have stood strong and continue to do so in the face of many a storm!”\n",
            " \n",
            "Our vision continues to be the leader in global digital transformation. We continue to achieve this by banking on our Values, which, as we have mentioned before, play out in everything we do. Our strategy, Leadership, processes, and people are all interconnected and are firmly rooted in our values. We believe in a superlative outcomes-driven portfolio of innovative and market-relevant solutions enabled fundamentally by our values. Below is how we feel about our values before we share stories as to how our values impact life at Company1_IT, Customers & the environment.\n",
            "1) Customer Success.\n",
            "Customers are at the heart of everything we do. The eventual outcome of everything we do should put a delightful smile on our customers’ faces. However, we understand that this obsession with Customers cannot be realised without a deep commitment to our people. If we can’t make Any employees smile, then they cannot make customers smile.\n",
            " 2) We care.\n",
            "‘We care’ is perhaps the most common catchphrase on the planet. But our understanding of this phrase is unique. To us, ‘We Care’ is not about saying these words. It is about showing it, walking the talk. As you would have read in some of our previous sections, a large piece of our organisation’s mindshare is geared towards it. In other words, we think, plan & execute ‘We care’. Though we are a tech company, we do not think like ‘Bots’! There is feeling and emotion connected to every ‘we care’ thing that we do.\n",
            "3) Execution excellence.\n",
            "We are perfectionists and believe that our delivery has character. Hence, whatever the area, Customers, People or Processes, we want to be top of the class. This value cannot be played out unless we build a supportive environment & provide tools to our people. With this value in our hearts & minds, we focus relentlessly on people enablement, delivery environment and boosting morale levels.\n",
            "4) Entrepreneurial spirit.\n",
            "Putting it simply, this value is about each person at Company1_IT accepting the company as their own. This value begets a culture where the thought and actions of our people are delivered with ownership. We encourage people to take risks and fail fast. Also, it is OK to fail but important to try with a stakeholder spirit.\n",
            "A brief History of our Values:\n",
            "We arrived at this new set of values in the year 2017. We revisited our earlier set of values (in place since 2014), as it was felt that it was no longer suitable for the organisation that we wanted to carve out in future. We were no longer the small company that we were when we started in 2014 and collectively had a clearer picture of the road ahead and how to build a digital leader in an evolving world. We have developed this set of values collaboratively, %u202Fdebating and discussing through a number of focus group discussions with senior leadership, Managers and Engineers, %u202Ftapping%u202Finto their insights on what the company should stand for.%u202F\n",

            "Story 1: Living ‘Customer Success’: NPS measurement:\n",
            "A major Life Science Customer wanted Company1_IT to take over development (running behind schedule and having quality issues) from another vendor and deliver the product to their end customer within the initially agreed timeline. The project involved Temperature Excursion Management with complex algorithms and many external integration points.\n",
            "Company1_IT ramped up a team of 50 people with the relevant skill set on a war footing, imparted product training, and conducted exhaustive planning sessions, and identified risks & mitigation steps to meet the deadline.\n",
            "We also collaborated and hosted multiple co-locations with employees, customers and external parties. Company1_IT identified the critical path and resolved all hurdles, including technical approach changes. Ensured quick turnaround by automation & supported 30% scope creep.  Our teams streamlined Dev and QA environments and introduced deployment discipline. Company1_IT invested in CoE teams to address NFRs and Delivery Excellence teams to address Life Science Regulatory documentation standards. Excellent tracking and monitoring, critical reviews & feedback, team commitment & collaboration resulted in the project going Live as per the commitment. This is not an individual-based story like the others that will follow but a team story. We believe teams are entities that influence the success of an organisation and that collaboration at the team level is critical for delivery. \n",
            "Customer Accolades -\n",
            "“This is excellent and much-awaited news! \n",
            "Achieving this important goal on time, with our promise to us, is a true team effort and a great example of what we can achieve when collaborating across teams and functions. We faced many obstacles during the project, but with your dedication and willpower, even the toughest obstacles were resolved.\n",
            "My warmest congratulations to everyone involved. You all played an important role in making this happen. Thank you!”\n",
            " Client VP – Technology R&D\n",
            " \n",
            "“It has taken a small army to get to this point, full of challenges with many teams to allow us to successfully hit this milestone for us. TEM will be a key new lever in helping move our larger premium customers to SaaS and also attract new Supplies customers as we incorporate full cumulative excursion tracking into our clinical supplies inventory management platform offering.”\n",

            " \n",
            "Story 2: Living ‘We care’:Bringing meaning & smiles:\n",
            "This story is about Sayani Das, who joined Company1_IT in 2019. According to her, she was aware of the culture and the warmth exuded by everyone in the company. In other words, she was truly inspired by this value. She was quick to join our Bringing Smiles initiative, which gave her purpose and made her incredibly proud of what we Any employees have given back to the community through this program since its inception.\n",
            "She visited the Samarthanam Trust for the Disabled and recorded an audiobook in the Digital Recording Studio created by Company1_IT. These audiobooks get stored in a central repository from where visually impaired children around the country can access and listen to stories. Her team and she interacted with the children there, discussed their aspirations, and shared stories of leaders, empowering them and instilling a lasting image of what leadership should look like. In 2020, we had multiple virtual sessions with children who are part of the National STEM Program, attended Virtual Literacy Sessions by Company1_IT, and organised various events during Christmas to entertain them. Experiences such as these left a deep sentiment in her mind. She viewed Company1_IT not just as an employer but as an altruistic organisation that genuinely cares about the well-being of others.\n",
            "Now let’s take a look at the Macro perspective. Since 2019 our ratings, reviews and comments related to ‘we care’ are creating a buzz on social media platforms. We believe that it is stories like these which have resulted in a massive impact. As mentioned earlier, from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022, our Glassdoor ratings have gone from 3.8 to 4.0, and many of our internal and external surveys indicate that growing engagement levels are directly linked to initiatives like this.  So, “We Care” is an infectious value which cuts across people, clients & society. It is more a way of life for us Any employees. Our employees feel tremendous pride in the work we do. In fact, we have also received feedback through various surveys that multitude of millennials are interested in working with us just to be a part of the Bringing Smiles programme.\n",
            "Story 3: Living ‘Execution Excellence’: Commitment to Win:\n",
            "Here is the story of Shashank Kumar; his tenure with Company1_IT started a year ago. He was selected for (and now graduated) our Account Management School (AMS), a rigorous and extensive program spanning over four months, featuring top executives and industry experts aiming to empower future account managers.\n",
            "He was working on a very large and complex client deal for a prospect for their upcoming modernisation program. He used the learning from AMS to research the industry, challenges, value chain, and the entire ecosystem. He participated actively in the bid team and, after two weeks of brainstorming, ideating, and strategising, created a proposal response comprising our understanding of their industry and challenges, technical solution, delivery approach, the team, and the commercials. The client feedback said that “there are many Tier-1 vendors also part of the bid, but no one has produced such a holistically thought solution that focused on business outcomes.”\n",
            "It is very clear from this story that our commitment to building execution excellence is very much in action at Company1_IT. We believe again that our soaring NPS scores are the result of this particular value as well. (CSAT scores have moved up from have moved from50 % to 73%). This is one such story amongst a myriad of stories where Company1_IT has enabled, supported, and educated people to gain a special place in the minds of clients & people alike.\n",
            "Story 4: Living ‘Entrepreneurial spirit’:\n",
            "Siddhant joined Company1_IT as a Data Scientist two and a half years ago, in April 2020 (right when COVID struck), and took it upon himself to spearhead several AI/ML engagements for various customers across different industry domains, and also developed in-house AI/ML capabilities.\n",
            "He researched, conceptualized, and led the developmental efforts for building AI/ML capabilities from scratch. He was supported by line managers, colleagues and leadership team members alike. According to him, there was no contempt, doubt or negative reactions to his choosing to take up this initiative for Company1_IT. He felt it was like translating his visions into reality. Siddhant went on to educate the organisation and finally impact customers. These efforts eventually led to presenting the capabilities to external stakeholders & winning numerous Customer deals, and it continues to bring in more pipelines and get resounding positive feedback from all customers.\n",
            "Thus, Entrepreneurial Spirit is an instrumental factor that enabled and empowered him to deliver such impactful outcomes is the rich & diverse culture of Company1_IT - from peers to senior management, ideas are welcomed & encouraged by providing a platform for experimentation. \n",

            "Description : \n",
            "“Our Strategy & Leadership is based on an integrated system of processes.”\n",
            "Our Strategy and Leadership play a critical role in shaping the direction and success of Company1_IT. We believe that effective leadership sets a clear vision and progression for the organisation, inspires and motivates employees, and makes decisions that align with our values. A well-crafted strategy outlines a plan for achieving those goals and guides the allocation of resources. Together, leadership and strategy provide direction and focus for the organisation, helping it to adapt to changing circumstances and achieve long-term success.\n",
            "To foster such an approach towards Strategy & Leadership, we have sustained certain key processes. A winning strategy and effective leadership cadres across levels are something that needs tending. These processes induce clarity, transparency, and systematic thinking and upgrade Leadership competencies.\n",
            "Annual Strategy Exercise.\n",
            "Every year a strategic business planning exercise is undertaken. This exercise involves all our teams from the Leadership levels across to the frontline. For the forthcoming year’s strategy, operating business plans and big initiatives are kicked off in September/October timeframe- with a spate of team and practice/ function level deliberations, internal plan reviews and feedback (ground up) from all relevant stakeholders. In due consultations with different internal teams and the analysts’ community, the strategy and operating plan are then finalised in November in a senior management meeting. \n",
            "An important perspective to this exercise is the complete awareness and accountability that is accepted by the entire organisation. We adhere with a commitment to this entire process, and it is ensured by our leaders & managers that this percolates across all levels. Hence, this plan is socialised with the next level broader management team and then cascaded down for further action- Business/ Function/ Practice level plans, budgets, and support sought from each other are fleshed out and agreed upon. \n",
            "Reviews & Goal Management.\n",
            "We have designed a calendar-driven process for reviewing progress on our Annual Strategic/Business Plans. To the extent possible, we try and objectify all goals and review them accordingly. A close watch is kept on all numbers/metrics to ensure success in all areas of functioning. Here we would also like to mention our V2MOM process.\n",
            "The acronym is V2MOM, and it stands for Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measurements. Marc Benioff, Co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, developed the V2MOM template for setting annual goals across an organisation. Our CEO Raj creates a new V2MOM and shares it with the entire company. In addition, every employee is encouraged to create and publish their own annual V2MOM plan. Hence Raj’s V2MOM is cascaded through the organisation. Raj shares him with direct reports, and they share it with their teams, and it keeps seeping across the organisation, where each and every person has their own V2MOM, which they need to execute.\n",
            " \n",
            " \n",
            "This V2MOM process displays organizational alignment and the strategic intent of an organisation. With this \n",

            " and focus on the WHY, WHAT, and HOW of the actions you perform.\n",
            "V2MOM works well when integrated with other frameworks and methods. The flow of adaptation usually begins with the creation of the strategy (or strategic intent). Then we can cascade the strategy to departments, teams, and products. The V2MOM can help translate the strategy into operational terms. Then we utilise OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to provide role clarity, performance metrics, and a structured language for disseminating information.\n",
            "Focus on Building Quality Leadership.\n",
            "Apart from designing an effective strategy and then using our V2MOM systems to cascade goals across the organisation, we also believe in growing & developing an effective leadership cadre. We believe that having a great process is simply not enough! We need competent leaders across levels and functions to be able to succeed. \n",
            "We have created the Company1_IT Leadership Behavior framework to identify leadership competencies. This drives a common framework for key ‘Success Behavior expectations’ for our colleagues in leadership roles. \n",
            "This framework, which is deeply aligned with our culture, consists of six leadership capabilities which are uniform across levels. Each leadership capability is further defined by eight identifiable behaviours which can be observed and hence assessed.

            "Since our inception, we have believed that building and maintaining a unique and exciting workplace is a continuously evolving process. We do not believe in resting on our laurels when it comes to creating a culture which energises every employee every day at the workplace. You will discover while reading through this document that this special environment at Company1_IT has been brewed with purpose. It has risen out of committed Leadership, effective design, processes, empathy & a highly motivated workforce.\n",
            "Our principles & beliefs are stronger than ever this year. We believe that it is from these five distinctive behaviours that our exclusive workplace has been born. These behaviours have led to our growth, immunity to challenges and the superlative brand that we are ever building with customers & employees alike.\n",
            "Our Values are strong, alive and in play at Company1_IT. All our leaders have them internalised. They live and disseminate these values across the organisation through action & speech every day. Our Values are: Our values are Company1-IT’s constitution.\n",
            "As you can see, our distinctive behaviours are connected deeply to our values. Without intent & distinctive behaviours, values are meaningless. Moving forward, we will try and express how our values and distinctive behaviours culminate into meaningful & effective systems. We believe that true success in attaining both Business & People delight comes from effective execution. We have a simple formula to express this.\n",
            "This deeper dive will show how values, distinctive behaviors & execution systems are connected at Company1_IT. It is this culture-creating dynamic which has given us the equity we possess today from both our customers and our people. Let’s look at each distinctive behaviour in more detail.\n",
            "Our mission to engineer a unique experience starts prior to Day 0 for a Any employee, even before the person walks into the workplace. We would like to showcase our induction & assimilation programme, Silk Road, below. The intent of the document is not only to highlight the processes but additionally bring out the enthusiasm and passion of Any employees.\n",
            " Silk Road, as the name suggests, utilises various communication media through which new joiners get a deeper introduction to Company1_IT. The idea is to engage with joiners even before they come on board with us and develop their understanding and preparedness on day 1 in the organisation.\n",
            "A customized practice-specific new joiner assimilation is followed with the objective of providing concise and updated information about the corporate and practice overview. This decentralisation makes the assimilation process quicker and easily administrable. It is important to note that our programme has important touch points such as building a thorough understanding of the business, knowing about career options at Company1_IT & feeling the culture.\n",
            "We have also introduced an onboarding excellence program in 2022 aiming to help Any employees (our people) settle down in their first 30 days in the organisation. This involves an array of activities, including an introduction to the Buddy. Through these measures, the overall onboarding favourability index, as captured in the 30-day survey, has gone up to 90% in 2022.\n",
            "Our Buddy program has proven to be extremely effective. New joiners get acquainted on a fast track with our work culture. They feel welcomed and cared for and get settled quickly. buddies are there to resolve their queries related to internal tools, technology, and other softer issues within the organisation.\n",
            "A workshop is conducted for those identified to play the role of a buddy from time to time (including refreshers) They are provided with a ready reference document, enabling them to play their role effectively. We believe that the skills of the ‘buddy’ have a direct correlation to the success of this programme and the newcomer’s experience.\n",
            "Once our people have been settled in and flow seamlessly into day-to-day work, we focus on making each day exciting. A large part of this experience is owned by leaders & people managers across all levels, from the frontline manager to the CXO. We believe that Customer Success (a Core Value) can only truly materialise if our people give their best.\n",
            "Here are our core engagement processes which are run both in letter & spirit by our leaders. Here again, we would stress the ‘spirit’ with which these programmes are run. It is a must that they are enthusiastic, fun, exciting & involving in every single member of the team.\n",
            "It is part of our culture to empower people, and as we continue our growth as an organisation, it becomes imperative to recognise and praise the achievements of our Any employees. As we went closer to the year’s end, we expressed our gratitude to our colleagues, who helped us deliver outstanding outcomes.\n",
            "Our leaders encouraged everyone to return to our key learning from our formative years of saying “Thank you” While appreciation and recognition are often used interchangeably, it is important to note that there is a slight difference between them. Recognition usually needs a token to express it – like a reward or a prize. appreciation is more like a culture - where saying thank you often, putting a team's needs over your own, all count as appreciation.\n",
            "Culture is what will help Company1_IT to be a digital leader. As part of the Company1-IT culture workshop, we talk about Company1's values and competencies to all existing employees, new joiners and campus freshers. We have also identified role models for each of these values and Competencies.\n",
            "These individual sessions aim to build a strong culture around company values and to inculcate these values in all Any employees. We have monthly sessions that are aimed to explain the Company1_IT context for each of the company values. The Any employees can demonstrate in their client projects and then share their success stories.\n",
            "Company1_IT has created an award by the name of Value champion to recognise those Any employees who consistently exhibit the behaviours associated with our values. The managers of the respective winners then do a ‘story-telling' session highlighting the behaviours of the individual which he/she exhibited, which resulted in them getting the award. This has led to building a culture and awareness across the organisation.\n",
            "In the year 2022, we’ve had more than 2400 Any employees in India rewarded by their managers using the Thanks portal. Including the managers, about 60% of Any employees participated in the recognition process in the year. Similarly, we also recognise the contributions of our team members through our 3, 5, 10 and 15th Anniversary awards.\n",
            "Additionally, we also take the moment to share our wishes with our team members who have witnessed a major event of joy in their personal lives- be it marriage or welcoming their small bundle of joy through our “Wedding” and “Happy Motherhood” gift policies.\n",
            "Every success for us as an organisation must be shared with everyone on the work floor. Celebrating success together creates a sense of unity and recognition. Our engagement teams weave together an unforgettable celebratory experience in line with our success. These are events of joy and achievement that the entire organisation shares together.\n",
            "Another core element to the superlative experience that we curate is Work-Life Balance and Wellness. Here again, genuine understanding and respect for the above is the key ingredient to success. At Company1_IT, it is not a ‘buzzword’ for the management to be dropped at meetings!\n",
            "As we moved into post COVID era in 2022, most of the organisations in the IT industry started asking employees to return to work. For us, it is always the health and safety of our employees first. We understood how the pandemic had impacted and scarred people. We wanted activity and buzz back again.\n",
            "Hence, though all our sites were made operational and we invited and didn’t force employees to work from the office. We continue with our policy of no fixed work timings or a mandatory number of hours to be logged in so that employees have the flexibility to attend to their personal needs while balancing the work.\n",
            "Company1_IT has a generous Health insurance plan in place that provides relief to employees in their hour of need for any medical exigency. This plan covers employees, their spouses and dependent children (ESC) under the company’s floater health insurance scheme with INR 5,00,000/year.\n",
            "We intend to provide the best medical support to our employees by enhancing the benefits in our existing policy each year. This year based on the feedback received by employees, we have added to our existing health insurance two additional benefits viz- Cataract (upgraded the coverage) and Fracture /injuries/dislocation of bone/joints Coverage.\n",
            "Our philosophy is to be ‘hell-bent’ on transparency & clarity. We want our people to be stakeholders in everything that we do. Whether it is a business strategy, workplace dynamics or even their own facilities and benefits, we involve our people in the information flow and decision-making.\n",
            "Employee benefits are critical for people to possess a hygienic level of happiness. In 2022, we refined some of our benefits to make them impactful and easily accessible. Here are some of the policies which we fine-tuned in consultation with our people via workshops.\n",
            "COVID introduced the Salary Advance policy through which employees can take a salary advance to support their immediate financial requirements. The policy was introduced to help employees cope with sudden personal needs. COVID's medical insurance benefit equips employees to deal with medical emergencies financially but at times, the expenses cannot be completely covered by them.\n",
            "We have also revitalised our Car lease policy based on employee feedback. We are engaging a new partner to make the benefit more impactful and easily accessible for the employees. We have also reinvigorated our Car lease Policy based on Employee feedback. This is based on the feedback we received from our employees.\n",
            "Employee feedback is critical for us, and we are always in motion to look at more ways to improve our policies. We currently use both internal and external surveys to gather feedback from our employees. We make our employees understand the challenges/risks of the organisation by giving them more business and industry-level information.\n",
            "Senior management leaders interact with smaller groups of Any employees in a completely informal setup(‘Ask me anything’),encouraging an open and hierarchy-less dialogue and culture. Skip-level meetings are usually done on a quarterly basis across practices and functions. It provides a platform for employees to directly connect with their level 2 or level 3 managers.\n",
            "We understand that some of the employees may not open up in team meetings; hence we follow an open-door policy. Any employee from any level can connect with any leader in the business without any hesitation or fear. These connects help the leaders to build rapport with our employees in a better way.\n",
            "We feel that there is no better way to win the hearts of our people than genuinely caring for their growth and career development. Our people realise that we want them to attain their personal goals aside from an organizational agenda. This deepens our bond and trust. We feel that this is the best way for us to win their hearts and minds.\n",
            "We empower Any employees with a tool which will help them understand where they are in their careers. We have a purposefully designed career framework in line with what our customers expect from us. We are committed to providing our employees with the tools they need to achieve their goals.\n",
            "We want every individual to have Pride of Progress associated with us and want to partner with them in this endeavor. Our comprehensive competency-driven Career Development program, CareerNXTand Company1_IT Academy, has been in operation since 2022. The program enables managers with a consistent and valuable tool to help the team members artfully navigate career growth conversations with their people.\n",
            "Social platforms are ideal for us to showcase life at Company1_IT. So we can both ‘tell stories’ and ‘listen to employees’ on these platforms. The information coming in from social channels is also statistically valid, as we have over 355K people on our network.\n",
            "We have also seen massive levels of participation from our people on social platforms. Any employees, acting as influencers, had a tremendous impact on our social channels. By creating more avenues for Any employees to share glimpses of ‘Life at Company1_IT’, the engagement rate has increased by 200% over the last two years.\n",
            "Storytelling and lore are also an integral part of our culture at Company1_IT. We capture our stories from work life, achievers, pioneers, kindness & camaraderie. These stories buzz our corridors, cafeterias, and meeting rooms. It gives us a sense of who we are and what we stand for.\n",
            "Any employees Speak is a collection of stories of Any employees who are shaping the future of digital experiences. These people embody the values of Company1_IT and are driven by Company1-IT’s strong sense of community. Any employees Speak: Share your stories of your employees.\n",
            "A Any employee’s journey provides a sneak peek into the life of Any employees in different job roles. People get to learn about their day-to-day operational activities, opportunities for growth and learning, and how Company1_IT supports their professional and personal ambitions.\n",
            "A valuable collection of testimonies from our youngest Any employees who have chosen to kick start their career with Company1_IT. They share their experience on how Company1-IT makes them future-ready to tackle real-world business and engineering problems. We hope to hear from you as well.\n",
            "Company1_IT’s With our Women Program aims at identifying and enabling our women to become Leaders. We share stories of women employees & leaders to inspire and motivate aspiring women at Company1_ IT. We believe that true strength is attained by working together to make our vision a reality. Diversity and inclusion are the cornerstones of this strength.\n",
            "Here we would like to illustrate how we track our ever-evolving and growing journey to build a happy and successful workplace. Company1_IT understands that it is not designing and buildinga culture that induces a special workplace. We are serious about tracking and assessing our initiatives and events.\n",
            "Overall global mobility: our numbers picked up significantly in Q3, and the trend is ongoing from the end of Q2. About 70 people moved globally in Q2, with about 70 people moving globally in the first three months of 2013. In Q3 alone, there were more than 70 people who moved globally.\n",
            "Employer Brand on Social Platforms: Glassdoor ratings for Company1_IT have gone from 3.8 to 4.0 on a scale of 5. Also, on Glassdoor, our CEO ratings have gone up from 86% to 91 %.   \n",
            "How do you ensure everyone - regardless of who they are or what job they do - is a full member of your organization and can reach their highest potential? How do you make sure everyone in your organization is a member of the team? What do you do to ensure everyone reaches their potential? Share your answers in the comments below.\n",
            "Our vision has always been centered on people. If you look at our values, you will see that they are actually all connected to human themes. We are a company of people, and we want to continue to be that way. We want to be a team of people. We don't want to just be a business.\n",
            "Our approach to maximising people’s potential would be supported by these five bastions. For example, there can be no Customer Success if we do not enable our people to succeed. If we don’t care for people, we cannot expect them to be committed. We aim to perform beyond the set excellence benchmarks.\n",
            "Company1_IT's onboarding is automated, with a built-in audio-based Induction module. Leadership team is very involved in inducting talent. Our CXOs devote several hours a week to talking to and interacting with incoming employees. This ensures enablement even before these people set foot in the organisation.\n",
            "A solid integration plan assumes a critical significance for setting up a new colleague for success. An individualized onboarding plan is prepared to help accelerate their integration into Company1_IT and ensure a smooth transition.

            "We have deployed several external IT systems, tools, and apps to effectively manage day-to-day employee transactions in a secure and efficient manner. For example, we use Fusion HRIS, which provides Employee/ Manager Self Services and hosts our employee data, and Net Suite, which we use for P&L, Project Allocation, Travel, Purchase, and other transactions. On top of it, we have an in-house developed employee app, ‘On the go (OT\n",
            "We extensively use Microsoft cloud-based workplace collaboration tools. SharePoint connects our employees to various systems like Payroll, OnTheGo, Fusion, FUEL, Salesforce, and Helpdesk. While MS Teams is used to chat, set up internal meetings, and collaborate across Company1_IT, Zoom is used for external meetings.\n",
            "To us, saying ‘we care’ aren’t just words but a living ethos. We have worked on building systems that offer our people an ecosystem where they can deliver their best. These systems focus on flexibility, comfort, self-esteem, motivation & empowerment.\n",
            "Here we’d like to tell the story of how our levels of care were heightened after experiencing the pandemic and post-pandemic tumult. What the organisation could clearly view was how the management, leadership and Human Resources rallied behind them in these times of strife. There is no greater motivator than kindness and empathy.\n",
            "We did not enforce any type of binding regulations regarding workplace and timings. We continue to do this to this very day. Having understood that the world and the nature of work have evolved and are in a state of flux after the pandemic. We are still doing this today.\n",
            "Our Bringing smiles CSR initiative has deeply impacted the psyche of so many of our employees. This has extended our empathy to the world at large.

These graduates are given preference for progression into a new Account Manager role over new hires from the market.\n",
            "It would not be wrong if we say that our engagement efforts start six (6) months prior to the actual joining. As one of the industry-best practices, we cover all freshers through 8 to 10 weeks of the ‘Learn before Joining Company1_IT (LBJ)’ program.\n",
            "For adjacent hires (those with 2 years of experience and having adjacent skills, and we on-boarded 125 new hires in the year), we upskill them through brushing up on their core tech skills, 5 weeks of the immersive training program, and a1-week Capstone project.\n",
            "Morale is a powerful driver, and a feeling of ownership is what gives us the edge. There are several processes, as you will see below, that are being used at Company1_IT to infuse this ‘Spirit’ into our people. Some of our signature initiatives which continue to build this are:\n",
            "A global millennial group of 20 employees across practices is formed periodically. This is a powerful inductor of ownership and morale. We get regular feedback from employees mentioning that this initiative invokes strong feelings of ownership. All these interactions were themed around transparency, role effectiveness, etc. This process involves even the most ‘fresh’ talent indecision-making.\n",
            "Developing our inner strengths is also key to us growing our potential. We believe and understand that there is considerable coaching and training capacity in every organisation. In the last quarter alone, ten senior project managers raised their hand to make a difference- to themselves as they realise their true potential and to the Organization.\n",
            "People from across the organisation voluntarily come together to organise fun events & celebrations.

If we can’t make Any employees smile, then they cannot make customers smile. We want to put a delightful smile on our customers’ faces.\n",
            "‘We care’ is perhaps the most common catchphrase on the planet. But our understanding of this phrase is unique. To us, 'We Care' is not about saying these words. It is about showing it, walking the talk. Though we are a tech company, we do not think like ‘Bots’! There is feeling and emotion connected to every ‘we care' thing that we do.\n",
            "We are perfectionists and believe that our delivery has character. This value cannot be played out unless we build a supportive environment & provide tools to our people.

Also, it is OK to fail but important to try with a stakeholder spirit.\n",
            "We revisited our earlier set of values (in place since 2014), as it was felt that it was no longer suitable for the organisation that we wanted to carve out in future. We were no longer the small company that we were when we started in 2014 and collectively had a clearer picture of the road ahead and how to build a digital leader in an evolving world.\n",

In addition, every employee is encouraged to create and publish their own annual V2mOM plan.\n",

Then we utilise OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to provide role clarity and performance metrics.\n",
