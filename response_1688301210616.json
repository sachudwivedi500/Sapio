    "Since our inception, we have believed that building and maintaining a unique and exciting workplace is a continuously evolving process. We do not believe in resting on our laurels when it comes to creating a culture which energises every employee every day at the workplace. You will discover while reading through this document that this special environment at Company1_IT has been brewed with purpose. It has risen out of committed Leadership, effective design, processes, empathy & a highly motivated workforce.",
    "Our principles & beliefs are stronger than ever this year. We believe that it is from these five distinctive behaviours that our exclusive workplace has been born. These behaviours have led to our growth, immunity to challenges and the superlative brand that we are ever building with customers & employees alike.",
    "Our Values are strong, alive and in play at Company1_IT. All our leaders have them internalised. They live and disseminate these values across the organisation through action & speech every day. Our Values are: Our values are Company1-IT’s constitution.",
    "As you can see, our distinctive behaviours are connected deeply to our values. Without intent & distinctive behaviours, values are meaningless. Moving forward, we will try and express how our values and distinctive behaviours culminate into meaningful & effective systems. We believe that true success in attaining both Business & People delight comes from effective execution. We have a simple formula to express this.",
    "This deeper dive will show how values, distinctive behaviors & execution systems are connected at Company1_IT. It is this culture-creating dynamic which has given us the equity we possess today from both our customers and our people. Let’s look at each distinctive behaviour in more detail.",
    "Our mission to engineer a unique experience starts prior to Day 0 for a Any employee, even before the person walks into the workplace. We would like to showcase our induction & assimilation programme, Silk Road, below. The intent of the document is not only to highlight the processes but additionally bring out the enthusiasm and passion of Any employees.",
    " Silk Road, as the name suggests, utilises various communication media through which new joiners get a deeper introduction to Company1_IT. The idea is to engage with joiners even before they come on board with us and develop their understanding and preparedness on day 1 in the organisation.",
    "A customized practice-specific new joiner assimilation is followed with the objective of providing concise and updated information about the corporate and practice overview. This decentralisation makes the assimilation process quicker and easily administrable. It is important to note that our programme has important touch points such as building a thorough understanding of the business, knowing about career options at Company1_IT & feeling the culture.",
    "We have also introduced an onboarding excellence program in 2022 aiming to help Any employees (our people) settle down in their first 30 days in the organisation. This involves an array of activities, including an introduction to the Buddy. Through these measures, the overall onboarding favourability index, as captured in the 30-day survey, has gone up to 90% in 2022.",
    "Our Buddy program has proven to be extremely effective. New joiners get acquainted on a fast track with our work culture. They feel welcomed and cared for and get settled quickly. buddies are there to resolve their queries related to internal tools, technology, and other softer issues within the organisation.",
    "A workshop is conducted for those identified to play the role of a buddy from time to time (including refreshers) They are provided with a ready reference document, enabling them to play their role effectively. We believe that the skills of the ‘buddy’ have a direct correlation to the success of this programme and the newcomer’s experience.",
    "Once our people have been settled in and flow seamlessly into day-to-day work, we focus on making each day exciting. A large part of this experience is owned by leaders & people managers across all levels, from the frontline manager to the CXO. We believe that Customer Success (a Core Value) can only truly materialise if our people give their best.",
    "Here are our core engagement processes which are run both in letter & spirit by our leaders. Here again, we would stress the ‘spirit’ with which these programmes are run. It is a must that they are enthusiastic, fun, exciting & involving in every single member of the team.",
    "It is part of our culture to empower people, and as we continue our growth as an organisation, it becomes imperative to recognise and praise the achievements of our Any employees. As we went closer to the year’s end, we expressed our gratitude to our colleagues, who helped us deliver outstanding outcomes.",
    "Our leaders encouraged everyone to return to our key learning from our formative years of saying “Thank you” While appreciation and recognition are often used interchangeably, it is important to note that there is a slight difference between them. Recognition usually needs a token to express it – like a reward or a prize. appreciation is more like a culture - where saying thank you often, putting a team's needs over your own, all count as appreciation.",
    "Culture is what will help Company1_IT to be a digital leader. As part of the Company1-IT culture workshop, we talk about Company1's values and competencies to all existing employees, new joiners and campus freshers. We have also identified role models for each of these values and Competencies.",
    "These individual sessions aim to build a strong culture around company values and to inculcate these values in all Any employees. We have monthly sessions that are aimed to explain the Company1_IT context for each of the company values. The Any employees can demonstrate in their client projects and then share their success stories.",
    "Company1_IT has created an award by the name of Value champion to recognise those Any employees who consistently exhibit the behaviours associated with our values. The managers of the respective winners then do a ‘story-telling' session highlighting the behaviours of the individual which he/she exhibited, which resulted in them getting the award. This has led to building a culture and awareness across the organisation.",
    "In the year 2022, we’ve had more than 2400 Any employees in India rewarded by their managers using the Thanks portal. Including the managers, about 60% of Any employees participated in the recognition process in the year. Similarly, we also recognise the contributions of our team members through our 3, 5, 10 and 15th Anniversary awards.",
    "Additionally, we also take the moment to share our wishes with our team members who have witnessed a major event of joy in their personal lives- be it marriage or welcoming their small bundle of joy through our “Wedding” and “Happy Motherhood” gift policies.",
    "Every success for us as an organisation must be shared with everyone on the work floor. Celebrating success together creates a sense of unity and recognition. Our engagement teams weave together an unforgettable celebratory experience in line with our success. These are events of joy and achievement that the entire organisation shares together.",

    "As we moved into post COVID era in 2022, most of the organisations in the IT industry started asking employees to return to work.

    "Our philosophy is to be ‘hell-bent’ on transparency & clarity. We want our people to be stakeholders in everything that we do. Whether it is a business strategy, workplace dynamics or even their own facilities and benefits, we involve our people in the information flow and decision-making.",
    "Employee benefits are critical for people to possess a hygienic level of happiness. In 2022, we refined some of our benefits to make them impactful and easily accessible. Here are some of the policies which we fine-tuned in consultation with our people via workshops.",
    "COVID introduced the Salary Advance policy through which employees can take a salary advance to support their immediate financial requirements. The policy was introduced to help employees cope with sudden personal needs. COVID's medical insurance benefit equips employees to deal with medical emergencies financially but at times, the expenses cannot be completely covered by them.",
    "We have also revitalised our Car lease policy based on employee feedback. We are engaging a new partner to make the benefit more impactful and easily accessible for the employees. We have also reinvigorated our Car lease Policy based on Employee feedback. This is based on the feedback we received from our employees.",
    "Employee feedback is critical for us, and we are always in motion to look at more ways to improve our policies. We currently use both internal and external surveys to gather feedback from our employees. We make our employees understand the challenges/risks of the organisation by giving them more business and industry-level information.",

    "We understand that some of the employees may not open up in team meetings; hence we follow an open-door policy. Any employee from any level can connect with any leader in the business without any hesitation or fear. These connects help the leaders to build rapport with our employees in a better way.",
    "We feel that there is no better way to win the hearts of our people than genuinely caring for their growth and career development. Our people realise that we want them to attain their personal goals aside from an organizational agenda. This deepens our bond and trust. We feel that this is the best way for us to win their hearts and minds.",
    "We empower Any employees with a tool which will help them understand where they are in their careers. We have a purposefully designed career framework in line with what our customers expect from us. We are committed to providing our employees with the tools they need to achieve their goals.",
    "We want every individual to have Pride of Progress associated with us and want to partner with them in this endeavor.

The program enables managers with a consistent and valuable tool to help the team members artfully navigate career growth conversations with their people.",

    "Our approach to maximising people’s potential would be supported by these five bastions. For example, there can be no Customer Success if we do not enable our people to succeed. If we don’t care for people, we cannot expect them to be committed. We aim to perform beyond the set excellence benchmarks.",
